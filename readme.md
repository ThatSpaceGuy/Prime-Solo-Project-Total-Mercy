Total Mercy
============
Application Overview
TotalMercy.com is a full-stack web application to track daily intercession centered on the Hour of Mercy (3:00 o’clock hour).  Members sign up to pray daily and log-in each day to report that they have prayed that day.  The application organizes the intercessors into teams and can give information about numbers of intercessors and times of the day covered by prayer.  The Member dashboard will display their team, where in the world it is currently the Hour of Mercy, and other inspirational items.  Members can sign up to be reminded to pray in a few different ways - initial plans are e-mail, text, and possibly Twitter and Facebook.   TotalMercy.com will use teams to organize and track members and prayer coverage, but this will not be part of the primary understanding of members - so as to not complicate their involvement.
